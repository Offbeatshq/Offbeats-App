## 🔁 Ways to Contribute (!Important)

So by now you understood what this project is about but what exactly we would be doing in these 3 months?
The goal of this repo is to create multiple games (we are not focused on one game but we would be making many small-big adventure games with their own stories) 🎮
To achieve this task we need to follow these steps:
1. Fork the repo 🍴
2. Create a new folder (IMP) and start creating your gaming files 📁
3. Issues would be sub divided meaning, a game can be divided into sub parts, one issue for making prompts, one for creating gaming assets like characters and last one for creating actual game python file 🎲
4. After doing your task make a pull request 🔄
5. Make sure you do not change someone else file. ❌
6. Plagiarism is big no and doing so may result in lost of ranks and ban from repo. 🚫
7. Based on efforts levels will be given 📈
8. If any issue contact me on tusharamd#5800 on discord 📞
